It was\nbuilt to read small images of handwritten numbers (the MNIST dataset),\nand correctly classify which digit was represented in the image.\n\nHere\u2019s the abridged version of how it works:\n\n-  Layer C1 is a convolutional layer, meaning that it scans the input\n   image for features it learned during training. It outputs a map of\n   where it saw each of its learned features in the image. This\n   \u201cactivation map\u201d is downsampled in layer S2.\n-  Layer C3 is another convolutional layer, this time scanning C1\u2019s\n   activation map for *combinations* of features. It also puts out an\n   activation map describing the spatial locations of these feature\n   combinations, which is downsampled in layer S4.\n-  Finally, the fully-connected layers at the end, F5, F6, and OUTPUT,\n   are a *classifier* that takes the final activation map, and\n   classifies it into one of ten bins representing the 10 digits.\n\nHow do we express this simple neural network in code?\n\n\n"

A subclass of ``torch.nn.Module`` will report the layers it has\ncreated and their shapes and parameters. This can provide a handy\noverview of a model if you want to get the gist of its processing.\n\nBelow that, we create a dummy input representing a 32x32 image with 1\ncolor channel. Normally, you would load an image tile and convert it to\na tensor of this shape.\n\nYou may have noticed an extra dimension to our tensor - the *batch\ndimension.* PyTorch models assume they are working on *batches* of data\n- for example, a batch of 16 of our image tiles would have the shape\n``(16, 1, 32, 32)``. Since we\u2019re only using one image, we create a batch\nof 1 with shape ``(1, 1, 32, 32)``.\n\nWe ask the model for an inference by calling it like a function:\n``net(input)``. The output of this call represents the model\u2019s\nconfidence that the input represents a particular digit. (Since this\ninstance of the model hasn\u2019t learned anything yet, we shouldn\u2019t expect\nto see any signal in the output.) Looking at the shape of ``output``, we\ncan see that it also has a batch dimension, the size of which should\nalways match the input batch dimension. If we had passed in an input\nbatch of 16 instances, ``output`` would have a shape of ``(16, 10)``.\n\n## Datasets and Dataloaders\n\nFollow along with the video beginning at [14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC0_FRiX-sw&t=840s)_.\n\nBelow, we\u2019re going to demonstrate using one of the ready-to-download,\nopen-access datasets from TorchVision, how to transform the images for\nconsumption by your model, and how to use the DataLoader to feed batches\nof data to your model.\n\nThe first thing we need to do is transform our incoming images into a\nPyTorch tensor.\n\n\n"

Each pass has an inner loop that\n**iterates over the training data** (line 4), serving batches of\ntransformed input images and their correct labels.\n\n**Zeroing the gradients** (line 9) is an important step. Gradients are\naccumulated over a batch; if we do not reset them for every batch, they\nwill keep accumulating, which will provide incorrect gradient values,\nmaking learning impossible.\n\nIn line 12, we **ask the model for its predictions** on this batch. In\nthe following line (13), we compute the loss - the difference between\n``outputs`` (the model prediction) and ``labels`` (the correct output).\n\nIn line 14, we do the ``backward()`` pass, and calculate the gradients\nthat will direct the learning.\n\nIn line 15, the optimizer performs one learning step - it uses the\ngradients from the ``backward()`` call to nudge the learning weights in\nthe direction it thinks will reduce the loss.\n\nThe remainder of the loop does some light reporting on the epoch number,\nhow many training instances have been completed, and what the collected\nloss is over the training loop.\n\n**When you run the cell above,** you should see something like this:\n\n::\n\n   [1,  2000] loss: 2.235\n   [1,  4000] loss: 1.940\n   [1,  6000] loss: 1.713\n   [1,  8000] loss: 1.573\n   [1, 10000] loss: 1.507\n   [1, 12000] loss: 1.442\n   [2,  2000] loss: 1.378\n   [2,  4000] loss: 1.364\n   [2,  6000] loss: 1.349\n   [2,  8000] loss: 1.319\n   [2, 10000] loss: 1.284\n   [2, 12000] loss: 1.267\n   Finished Training\n\nNote that the loss is monotonically descending, indicating that our\nmodel is continuing to improve its performance on the training dataset.\n\nAs a final step, we should check that the model is actually doing\n*general* learning, and not simply \u201cmemorizing\u201d the dataset. This is\ncalled **overfitting,** and usually indicates that the dataset is too\nsmall (not enough examples for general learning), or that the model has\nmore learning parameters than it needs to correctly model the dataset.\n\nThis is the reason datasets are split into training and test subsets -\nto test the generality of the model, we ask it to make predictions on\ndata it hasn\u2019t trained on:\n\n\n"
